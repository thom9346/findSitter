# FindASitter

This is an Angular application that was written during my Computer Science classes in 2018. It explores the basic features of Angular such as Components, Rotuing, Dependency Injection, Services, e2e testing, etc. 

This is an example project merely meant to test and learn the capabilities of Angular and have no real-world use-case.

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli version 1.6.8.


# Building and running 

Please note that this is not a maintained project. Newer versions of angular will likely NOT be able to run this project.
To run I recommend using [Node Version 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.15.0/) and Angular@6.08.

After installing:

Run `npm install` to install dependencies
Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` to start the application

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
